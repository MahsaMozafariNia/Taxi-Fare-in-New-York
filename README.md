# Taxi-Fare-in-New-York
#### This project is about taxi fare in New York
#### There are some training and test datas.
#### It has 8 features. {Date-key-pickup Longitude-pickup Latitude-dropoff Longitude-dropoff Latitude-fare amount-passenger-count}
#### <span style="color:blue">some **First we apply some data engineering such as: removing missing data or a data with negative fare amount of negative passeng-count.** text</span>
#### <font color='blue'> Since the number of missing data is less than 5 percent of training datas, we can remove those row in the dataframe.
  #### <font color='blue'> After that we use a map to see the pickup Longitude-pickup Latitude-dropoff Longitude-dropoff Latitude on the map. we can also remove those datas that has pickup or dropoff coordinate in the water.
  #### at the end we apply some regression algorithms to predict fare amount of test data.
